# This makes the dependencies of the binary more consistent
# with the dependencies of execution environment tests and
# allows the binary to reuse most of the build artifacts
# produced by `cargo test`.

# This feature doesn't actually do anything. It is just convenient because it
# allows us to use the same cargo flags for building sandbox_launcher as we have
# for canister_sandbox.
