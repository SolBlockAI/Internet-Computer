# Developer How-To

## How-To Add Python Packages
- one-off installation: `pip install <requested package>`
- permanent installation:
1. add python package to `requirements.in` -> you do not have to pin a version here, pip-tools will automatically find the correct version when it pins the requirements file. In fact, it is better not to pin a version, but rather use >= or < so as not to restrict other package versions.
1. `bazel run //:python-requirements.update`
1. commit `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt`


# How to install python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- `pip-sync` (will also uninstall unneeded dependencies)
- If you get permission errors, run: `pip-sync --user`
- Alternatively `pip install -r requirements.txt` will install all required packages, but won't remove or upgrade old ones (this is why `pip-sync` is better, if not running in a virtual environment).

## How-To Auto Format All Python Code
- pre-commit run -a

## Python tests
### How-To Run Python Tests That Are Not in Bazel
- `pytest`

### How-To Make Pytest Emit Logging Output
- `pytest --log-cli-level=10`

### How-To Make Pytest Emit Stdout
- `pytest -s`

## How to start a virtual environment and install required packages
Ideally virtual environments should not be needed at all. They are only intended if you are developing python code and want to ensure that new packages you are testing do not conflict with pre-installed packages. If you do need a virtual environment, there are two approaches:

- Option 1 `venv` (pre-installed):
1. `python3 -m venv env`
1. `source env/bin/activate`
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. to exit the virtual env: `deactivate`
- Option 2 `pipenv`:
1. If not pre-installed, run `pip install pipenv`
1. `pipenv shell`
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. to exit the virtual env: `exit`

Troubleshooting pipenv:

There have been some issues using pipenv because of conflicting versions pre-installed in the shared directory vs what users have in their home directory. You can see where pipenv is installed using `which pipenv`.
If you see strange errors while using pipenv try this:

- Uninstall pipenv by running `pip uninstall virtualenv` and `pip uninstall pipenv`
- Retry the command `pipenv shell`
- If that fails, try re-installing pipenv with `pip install --user --upgrade pipenv`
